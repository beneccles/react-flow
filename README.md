# React Flow
___

This app is a react port of [Fluid Simulation][https://codepen.io/aecend/pen/WbONyK] by Jeff Thomas. The Fluid Simulation pen is awesome, and if you have the time I recommend that you check it out. In a nutshell, this app will simulate a fluid that can be interacted with by the user.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to give me practice coding with React hooks, and to gain a better understanding of the Javascript behind particle animation. Once thats done, I want to figure out how I can do my own particle animations from scratch.
